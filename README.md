# data-sourcing-challenge

**This is my repository for the Module 6 Challenge, 'data_sourcing_challenge'. The only parts I had some troubles with were piecing together the URL's correctly and also getting the data frames' titles to match. The URL's just took a bit of time reading the API websites and moving things around. For the titles, I was confused because in the NYT data frame, it wanted " Review" to be on the end of every title. However, if I used that for the TMDB API it would not find any of the movies, nor would it merge the two DFs on title because of the discrepancy. I ended up just taking out the " Review" part completely and everything ran accordingly (I know I will probably get some points taken off for that, lol.) The rest of the challenge went as smooth as it could, getting at least some of the coding right the first time is always a great feeling. I also noticed that my columns in the merged data frame were not in the same order as the example csv, so I made sure to at least bring the title to the forefront so that you know what you're looking at. *also note that I do not have a dotenv file because all of my API keys are stored directly to my operating system, as this is my personal computer and I am not worried about anyone else using it.* All in all, the challenge was definitely challenging, but I feel I handled it the best I could and am happy with my results.**
